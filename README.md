# Water Quality Explorer

Welcome to the Water Quality Explorer, a versatile tool for analyzing and visualizing water quality data. This application provides a user-friendly interface to explore insights into various water parameters and employs machine learning for sample classification.

## Features:

- **Data Visualization:** Utilize histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to showcase the distribution and relationships of water parameters.

- **Cluster Analysis:** Leverage K-Means clustering to categorize water samples into distinct groups based on their unique features.

- **Machine Learning Classification:** Implement a robust Random Forest model to classify water samples, providing predictive insights into your dataset.

## Getting Started:

1. **Load Data:**
   - Ensure your water quality data is in CSV format.
   - Utilize the `read.csv()` function to seamlessly load your dataset.

2. **Explore Data:**
   - Check for null values and duplicates using `is.null()` and `duplicated()` functions.
   - Create informative histograms and scatter plots to visually understand the distribution and relationships among water parameters.

3. **Cluster Analysis:**
   - Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to unveil natural groupings within your dataset.

4. **Machine Learning Classification:**
   - Prepare your data by dividing it into training and testing sets.
   - Train a Random Forest model using the `randomForest()` function and assess its accuracy through cross-validation.

## Dependencies:

- **R Libraries:**
  - Tidyverse
  - GGally
  - randomForest
  - caret

## Usage:
